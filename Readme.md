# Software Renderer

This project is a small software renderer which pipeline mimicks that of OpenGL in a simplified version. It is based on a [short computer graphics course](https://github.com/ssloy/tinyrenderer/wiki/Lesson-0:-getting-started) written by Dmitry Sokolov. It is written in C++17 and has no dependencies (especially no graphic libraries since the goal was to write one).
